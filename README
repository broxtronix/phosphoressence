The NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline Version Alpha-something

*** IMPORTANT ***
This is an ALPHA release of the Stereo Pipeline.  There are many
known bugs and incomplete features, and the API will almost certainly
change prior to the final release.  Much of the documentation is
incomplete or incorrect.  Although we hope you will find this release
helpful, you use it at your own risk.


************************************************************************
1. INTRODUCTION

The NASA Ames Stereo pipeline is a modular, extensible, cross-platform
computer vision software framework written in C++.  It was designed to
support a variety of space exploration tasks, including ...

B. Third-Party Libraries

This distribution includes some bundled third-party software as a
convenience to the user.  This software, located in the "thirdparty/"
directory, is not covered by the above-mentioned distribution
agreement or copyright.  See the included documentation for detailed
copyright and license information for any third-party software.  In
addition, various pieces of the Vision Workbench depend on additional
thrid-party libraries that the user is expected to have installed.
The specific dependencies of each component of the Vision Workbench
are discussed section 3, "LIBRARY STRUCTURE", and information of where
to obtain non-bundled third-party libraries is provided in section 4,
"INSTALLATION".

************************************************************************
3. LIBRARY STRUCTURE

The Stereo Pipeline software is located in the directory "src/"
and consists of a core library and several optional libraries or
"modules".  Each module is contained in a subdirectory with the name 
name as the module.

[[ Again, someone more knowledgeable about the structure should fill this out. ]]

4. INSTALLATION AND USE

A. Obtaining the Software

If you are reading this text then presumably you have a copy of 
the Vision Workbench software.  However, you can obtain the most 
recent version from

  http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/??

Before attempting to configure, build or install the Stereo Pipeline
you should obtain and install any prerequisite libraries that you
need.  The only absolute requirement is the Boost.  The others are 
either required to build a specific module, or will enable a 
particular feature if available.  A complete list of dependencies 
is shown in the table below, where each library is noted as being 
either a required or optional dependency of one or modules.  All of 
these libraries are distributed under some variation on the themes 
of the MIT and BSD licenses.  See each individual library's 
documentation for details.

+------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Library | Relevant Modules   | Source Website                     |
+---------+--------------------+------------------------------------+
| Boost   | Core, etc. (req.)  | http://www.boost.org/              |
| others  | to be filled out   | http://www.tbd.com/                |
+---------+--------------------+------------------------------------+

In addition, some Stereo Pipeline modules require other, lower
level modules to be built.  The internal Vision Workbench dependency
table appears below.  

[[ table to be built by someone who knows better ]]


B. Building and Installing

Once you have obtained and installed all of the prerequisite software
the process of building the Stereo Pipeline itself is generally
straightforward.  There are four steps:

i. Configure the library.  This is usually as simple as running the 
"./configure" script from within the root Vision Workbench package 
directory.

ii. Build the library, by running "make".

iii. Run the tests, by running "make check".

iv. Install the library, by running "make install".

By default the library will be installed into a directory called 
"build/" within the Stereo Pipeline package tree, in a subdirectory 
named for the particular platform you've built it for.  If you prefer 
a more conventional installation into, for example, "/usr/local/", 
then pass the command line argument "--prefix=/usr/local" to 
the configure script in step i.

While this simple sequence will suffice for most users, the configure
script has many options that you can use to adjust various properties,
such as compiler optimization flags or the search paths used to find
required libraries.  See the "INSTALL" file in this directory for more
detailed information.

C. Using the Library

When you install the library it will place files into three
subdirectories in the installation location.  The header files which
you will need to develop software using the library are located in the
"include/" subdirectory.  The compiled libraries, which you will need
to link your software against, are located in the "lib/" subdirectory.
You will need to configure your software development environment as
appropriate to locate these files.  Finally, a number of simple
command-line tools are provided in the "bin/" directory.  These are 
intended primarily as demo applications, but many of them are in fact 
useful in their own right.  See the documentation for a complete list 
of the tools.

5. DOCUMENTATION

Yes, we should have some documentation.

B. Credits

The Stereo Pipeline was developed within the Autonomous Systems and 
Robotics area of the Inteligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames 
Research Center.  It leverages the Intelligent Robotics Group's (IRG)
extensive experience developing surface reconstruction and tools for
planetary exploration---e.g. the Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration
Rover missions---and rover autonomy.  It has also been developed in 
collaboration with the Adaptive Control and Evolvable Systems (ACES) 
group, and draws on their experience developing computer vision 
techniques for autonomous vehicle control systems.

The lead developers of the Stereo Pipeline are Laurence Edwards 
(IRG, Project Manager), Michael Broxton (IRG), and Matthew Hancher 
(ACES).  See the AUTHORS file for a complete list of developers.
