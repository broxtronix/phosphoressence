Installation, short version
===========================

C++ Prerequisites:
  - boost
  - sdl
  - Vision Workbench
  - liblo
  - rtaudio  
  - qt4

Python
  - pyrex (needed to install pyopenvg)
  - pyopengl

You will also need to install these for vector graphics support:
  - shivavg 
  - pyopenvg

Note that shivavg does not build natively on OSX.  You may need to do
some very minor tweaking to the shivavg build system to get it to
work.

A quick note about Snow Leopard compatibility: Both Qt and SDL have
serious issues with snow leopard.  You will need SDL 1.3 or greater
and Qt 4.6 or greater.


Once you have prerequisites installed, you should run:

./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

Optionally, copy over one of the cofigure.options.something to
configure.options and edit for your particular environment.
