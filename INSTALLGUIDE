Installation, short version
===========================

./configure
make
make install

Optionally, copy over one of the cofigure.options.something to
configure.options and edit for your particular environment.


Optional module installations
=============================

MBA
---
This software is included in the Stereo Pipeline's thirdparty directory.
Before the Stereo Pipeline can be configured to work with it, it must
be built.  Simply running make in its directory should do the trick.  If
you have includes in non-standard locations, you may need to add them to
the INCLUDEDIRS variable in the Makefile.

Once it is built, add this line:

`pwd`/thirdparty/MBA_1.0_gpl

to the PKG_PATHS variable in your config.options file.  Then you run the
Stereo Pipeline's configure script, it should be found.


CSPICE
------
The C version of the SPICE toolkit can be found at http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/
which contains complete instructions for its installation on your system.

If you have installed cspice in /usr/local/cspice, then add that directory to the
PKG_PATHS variable in your config.options file.  

At the time of this writing, the cspice toolkit builds its library
files without the "lib" prefix which is required by the GNU linker
tools.  If you find that even after adding the cspice directory to
your PKG_PATHS variable that Stereo Pipeline's configure script is
still not finding it, visit your cspice's lib directory (e.g.
/usr/local/cspice/lib/).  If that directory contains library files (*.a)
that don't start with "lib", then you'll need to make some symbolic links,
for example:

ln -s cspice.a libcspice.a
ln -s csupport.a libcsupport.a
