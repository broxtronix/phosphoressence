m4_pattern_allow([^PKG_BOOST_SAME_SUFFIX])

dnl Here's a new version of AX_PKG_BOOST_LIB designed to find the
dnl multithreaded boost libraries and boost libraries that are just weirdly
dnl named in general. Boost libraries follow a weird naming convention
dnl that makes our old logic not work. You can't just add -mt to the old
dnl library you're looking for, because the -compiler part comes first.
dnl IE, the non-multithreaded library would be named libboost_X-gcc41.so,
dnl and the multithreaded library would be named libboost_X-gcc41-mt.so.
dnl
dnl For that reason, we've added an environment variable:
dnl BOOST_LIBRARIES_SUFFIX. The function here tries to find a version of
dnl Boost with the string in said variable somewhere inside the Boost
dnl library names, but after the initial name of the library (specified
dnl as the second parameter to this function). A blank value will give
dnl normal behavior.
