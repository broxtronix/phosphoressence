"""A simple splines package.

This package aims to be simple to use, but also simple to read - it's as much an exegesis on splines as it is a package. It's also developed to support somewhat more general exploratory programming with curves, so it supports slightly peripheral things like the ability to fit low-order polynomials to sequences of points.

Note that the only code in the package which knows the dimensionality of the space being worked in is the Point class. This code is two-dimensional, but a few changes to Point would make it three-dimensional.

Performance is almost certainly execrable.

"""

"""todo:

- make calculation of multiple points more efficient; support a form of call which evaluates over a range or an iteratable of u values
- allow subclasses to handle this themselves, so they can cache intermediate results
- support slices in the spline subclasses, maybe - do this by supporting slice objects as parameters to __getitem__
- does list() use slices? in 2.2, it appears to use getitem with scalar indices - and not to use len, but to rely on getting an IndexError!
